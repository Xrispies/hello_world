hello_world
===========

My first repository

This is the beginning of a new era in the battle against computational ignorance

Here is where I am entering text from my local machine for the first time.
I used the command 'git pull origin master' to fetch and merge the master
  fork of hello_world with the git repository I had created on my local
  machine under ~/Projects/hello_world.
I am next going to use:
  git commit -m "Update README.md with pull and commit documentation."
  git push
  in order to push these local changes to the remote GitHub repository.
